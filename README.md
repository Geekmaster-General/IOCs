# IOCs
This is for storing the IOCs I collect during my usual day-to-day security activities, and from OSINT research.

All information is public. 

All sensitive information has already been redacted.

I will add CSV files regularly.

IP's already reported to AbuseIPDB.

The formatted CSV files are ready for upload into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Custom Indicators lists.
